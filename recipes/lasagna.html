    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

    <p>
      This easy cheesy lasagna recipe is a simple lasagna that takes about half the effort of traditional versions. I
      always make extra for leftovers, but the more I cook, the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 1 pound bulk italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>&#189 cup warm water</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black paper</li>
        <li>1&#189 teaspoons dried sage</li>
        <li>1 pinch dry basil</li>
        <li>2(14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1(16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>              
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder, pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 minutes more.</p></li>
